# Detect Pullups

Doing pullups or other hanging stuff and have lots of timeseries data?

This lib is for you!

## Features

- Detect hang weight
- Count pullups in a set

## Commands

TSDX scaffolds your new library inside `/src`. Thanks TSDX team!

To run, use:

```bash
yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

To do a one-off build, use `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `yarn test`.
