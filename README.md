# Pullup tracking

It's hard to remember to do your exercises. Sometimes it's hard find the motivation too!

The goal of this system is to provide notifications and tracking for both.

## Outline

- Mobile app to see stats and get notifications
- Hardware controller to detect pullups
- Firebase functions to process the data
- Admin web app to manage data and settings

## Usage

### Clean

`yarn clean` will reset most things
`yarn clean:all` for those cases when you really want to start from scratch

### Start mobile app

- `yarn mobile`
