## Analysis:

impulse momentum theorem as follows:
F = m \* (vf â€“v0) / t

The propulsive phase of each repetition as the part of the concentric phase in which measured acceleration was higher than g (i.e. a > 9.81 m/s2)

F is MPF (in N)
m the system mass (i.e. body mass plus external load, in kg)
vf is the final velocity of the propulsive phase (in m/s)
v0 is the initial propulsive velocity of the concentric phase (in m/s)
t is the duration of the propulsive phase (in s)
MPP was computed as the product of MPF and MPV: MPP = MPF \* MPV
